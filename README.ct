This is the same as the standard iproute2 except for the
changes listed below:

*  iproute2:  Allow 'ip addr flush' to loop more than 10 times.

*  iproute2:  Fix parsing of comments in batch mode.
   The old code would treat any # as the start of comments,
   but this makes batching with mac-vlans (typical name
   is: eth0#1) silently do the wrong thing.

   With this patch, # are only treated as starting a comment
   when at the beginning of a line or when immediately preceded
   by whitespace.
